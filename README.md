# Neurocomputing Multi-Object Detection Application

A novel architecture based on a unique application of neuromorphic computing that manages a comprehensive pipeline of components designed to detect and analyze human presence in real-time using Event-based cameras and deployed on edge computing devices.

* This 3D plot offers a visual representation of detected humans along with their corresponding spike trains.
* The right image illustrates the data of the first 25 objects along with 0-75 objects,
* And the right 3D plot provides an overview of the data from the first 100 detected objects.
